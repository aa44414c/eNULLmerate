A project used to do initial enumeration of a system for ethical penetration testing.  This is designed to work with Kali Linux as the primary operating system.

## Disclaimer
This tool is intended for the use of ethical penetration testing ONLY.  This should not be run on systems without prior consent in the form of a signed penetration testing engagement and permission from the customer you are testing with.  Misuse of the script outside of its intended purpose is the fault of the user and not the script or the script developer.
